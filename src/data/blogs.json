        "content": "Big O notation is a mathematical concept used in computer science to describe the efficiency of algorithms, particularly in terms of time and space complexity. It expresses the upper bound of an algorithm's running time as input size grows, helping developers understand performance at scale. For example, an algorithm with O(n) complexity grows linearly with input size, while O(n²) grows quadratically. Big O ignores constants and lower-order terms to focus on dominant factors. It’s crucial in algorithm analysis, enabling better design choices and optimization. Understanding Big O helps programmers write faster, more efficient code that performs well with large datasets."
